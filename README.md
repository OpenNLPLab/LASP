## Abstract

Sequence Parallel (SP) serves as a prevalent strategy to handle long sequences that exceed the memory limit of a single GPU. However, existing SP methods do not take advantage of linear attention features, resulting in sub-optimal parallelism efficiency and usability for linear attention-based language models. In this paper, we introduce Linear Attention Sequence Parallel (LASP), an efficient SP method tailored to linear attention-based language models. Specifically, we design an efficient point-to-point communication mechanism to leverage the right-product kernel trick of linear attention, which sharply decreases the communication overhead of SP. We also enhance the practical efficiency of LASP by performing kernel fusion and intermediate state caching, making the implementation of LASP hardware-friendly on GPU clusters. Furthermore, we meticulously ensure the compatibility of sequence-level LASP with all types of batch-level data parallel methods, which is vital for distributed training on large clusters with long sequences and large batches.
We conduct extensive experiments on two linear attention-based models with varying sequence lengths and GPU cluster sizes. LASP scales sequence length up to 4096K using 128 A100 80G GPUs on 1B models, which is 8$\times$ longer than existing SP methods while being significantly faster.


## Installation
The code only depends on `torch` and `triton`, it has been tested with `torch==2.1.1`, `triton==2.0.0` and `triton-nightly==2.1.0.dev20230728172942` on A100 and 3090 GPU platforms.

We recommend you to install `triton` and `triton-nightly` using the following commands:
```
pip install triton==2.0.0
pip install triton-nightly==2.1.0.dev20230728172942 --index-url https://aiinfra.pkgs.visualstudio.com/PublicPackages/_packaging/Triton-Nightly/pypi/simple/
```

To install LASP from source, run:
```
git clone https://github.com/OpenNLPLab/LASP.git
cd LASP
# -e signified dev mode since e stands for editable
pip install -e .
```


## Code Structure

The code is organized as follows:
- `tests/` contains the launch script and test file for run testing.
- `lasp/` contains the implementation of lasp and its improved variants, including `lasp_native`, `lasp_cache`, `lasp_fuse`, `lasp_fuse_parallel` and the non-sequence parallel version: `lightning_attention`.
- `lasp/utils/` contains the communication manager for lasp, i.e., `seq_parallel_manager`, and other utils functions.

## Usage
The provided code supports the hybrid of Data Parallel (DP) (batch-level) and Sequence Parallel (SP) (sequence-level) on linear attention.
As an example, assume we have 1 node with 8 GPUs and the ranks are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}.
For data parallel size = 2 and sequence parallel size = 4, the DP and SP communication groups will be:

4 data_parallel groups (with global rank indices):
```
(0, 4), (1, 5), (2, 6), (3, 7)
```
2 sequence paralell groups (with global rank indices):
```
(0, 1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6, 7)
```
In summary, the group maping (with their own rank indices) is as follows:
```
Global ranks:             0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
Data parallel ranks:      0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1
Sequence parallel ranks:  0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 2, 3
```

Run the following commands:
```
cd tests
bash script.sh
```

You will test LASP with randomly generated `Q, K, V` and `dO` under the following distributed cases sequentially:

| Parallel Type | Case1  | Case2 | Case3 | Case4 |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| Data Parallel Size | 1 | 2 | 4 | 8 |
| Sequence Parallel Size | 8 | 4 | 2 | 1 |

Other configuratures used in the test is batch size per device `b=2`, sequence length `n=2048`, number of heads `h=12` and head dim `d=128`. 

By running the test, you will get the mean difference values of `Oi`, `dQi`, `dKi` and `dVi` obtained by LASP, comparing with the reference values of Lightning Attention (see our lightning attention work at: https://github.com/OpenNLPLab/lightning-attention).

## Benchmark

### Difference Results on 4 A100 GPUs
Following is the difference results obtained by running `tests/script.sh` on 4 A100 GPUs, i.e., run:
```
for dp_size in 1 2 4
do
    START_TIME=`date +%Y%m%d-%H:%M:%S`

    LOG_FILE=${logger_dir}/${START_TIME}-dp-size-${dp_size}.log
    torchrun --nproc_per_node 4 \
    test.py --dp-size ${dp_size} \
    2>&1 | tee -a $LOG_FILE
done
```
